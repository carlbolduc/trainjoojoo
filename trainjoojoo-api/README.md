Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


After migrating the database (`bin/rails db migrate`), run these two tasks:

- `bin/rails import_body_parts`
- `bin/rails import_exercises`
